    "text": "TFLite Micro is the most popular Neural Network inference engine for micro CPUs. It’s designed for light weight model running on low power hardwares.\nMost common scenario is you use some training framework like PyTorch and TensorFlow, quantize it to tflite model. Finally you run your model on embedded device through the TFLite Micro library. However, the precision of the model usually loses during the quantization process. People would like to use the TFLite Python API to run the model on their computer, and verify the accuracy of the model is reduced to an acceptable level before deploying it to the embedded device. The problem is that the TFLite Python API cannot really simulate the model’s precision when running on the embedded device with TFLite Micro library. There are already lots of discussions about this issue, see github discussions 1 and 2\nUnknown to many people, TFLite Micro has a Python API, but the TFLite Micro Python API is different from the TFLite Python API. The TFLite Micro Python API is designed to run on the same principles as the TFLite Micro C++ library, which means it can provide a more accurate simulation of how the model will perform on embedded devices.\nIn this blog I will compare the TFLite Python API and the TFLite Micro Python API differences, and show how the two different APIs can be used to run the same model but have different results."

TFLite Micro pre-allocates all memory at compile time or initialization using a fixed-size arena. Embedded systems often lack heap allocation or have strict memory constraints, so TFLite Micro avoids malloc/free entirely.\nGet input and output tensors details:\ninput_details = interpreter.get_input_details(index)\noutput_details = interpreter.get_output_details(index)\nCompare to TFLite Python API where you can get all input and output details through one function call. In TFLite Micro Python API, you need to specify the index of the input or output tensor to get its details. For example, if you have multiple inputs or outputs, you can get the details of each one by specifying its index:\ninput_details = interpreter.get_input_details(0)  # Get details of first input tensor\noutput_details = interpreter.get_output_details(1)  # Get details of second output tensor\nSet input tensor:\n# Set input tensor using the input index\ninterpreter.set_input(x, 0)\n# If you have second input tensor:\ninterpreter.set_input(y, 1)\nCompared to TFLite Python API where you set the input tensor using the input details index, in TFLite Micro Python API, you set the input tensor using the input index directly. The index range depends on how many inputs you have. The order between the data and the index was reversed as well.\nRun inference:\ninterpreter.invoke()\nGet output tensor:\noutput_data = interpreter.get_output(0)\nThe same as set input tensor, you can use the output index depending on how many outputs you have."

My suggestion is if you want to check or reproduce your embedded tflite-micro result with python script, tflite-micro python package is a better choice than tflite python package. But due to the slow inference speed of tflite-micro package, it’s not suitable for evaluation the whole evaluation dataset."
